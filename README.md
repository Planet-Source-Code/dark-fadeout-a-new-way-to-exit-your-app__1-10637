## FadeOut: A new way to exit your App


</div>

### Description

Another piece of code based on Alphablending.. This time it's a neat way to exit your application.. simply add the OCX to your project, and when its time to exit, call the fade1.fadeExit sub and your app will fade away and terminate.. ok so its useless, but it looks nice.. no screenshot since the effect is timebased (still shots wouldnt do it justice) - updated with missing Msimg32.dll - thx to VipeI2
